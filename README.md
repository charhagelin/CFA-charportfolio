###### So this is it, my very first website I've ever designed and coded.  
###### I hope that it will reflect me as a graphic designer and web developer. Changes will be made as I grow as a web developer. 

### The first major challenge at CFA was to create our own portfolio.

requirments: 
-- A thoughtfully written bio.
-- Portfolio section for your projects.
-- A way to contact you.
-- Attitude/Quirkiness
-- Hiroku Deployment.

I started out by making a moodbord by selecting website designs that I really liked by other designers/ developers to get a clear view of what style I was drawn to. I then continued by drawing out a design in Illustrator.

I eneded up making a few changes from my original design as I went.
